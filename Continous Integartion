GIT AND GIT HUB :

GIT : Is a Version Control Application.

GIT HUB : collabaration platform.


GIT HUB :

branch : developer team one
pull rquest : compare code in two branch

1.Create a branch off of master
2.Make commits
3.Open a pull request
4.Collaborate
5.Make more commits
6.Interact with integrations
7.Merge to master branch

Salesforce DX :

Scratch Org : A org with 30 day life time for developement.As they are ephemeral  by nature good for developing a new feature.
They work great for testing.

1. Enable DEV HUB.
2. Insatll CLI.https://sfdc.co/sfdx_cli_win
   check properly install by typing sfdx on cmd.
   sfdx force --help (available topic)
   sfdx force:doc:commands:list (All available commands)

3. Login to DevHub
    (sfdx force:auth:web:login -h
	sfdx force:auth:web:login --help)

	-d:default -a:alias
	sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a DevHub
	
	result : 
	Gone open Default browser with AUTHENTICATION URL .
	Login to Source Org,allow it.
	Receive
	get org with sepcific username and org id.

4.
	Set Up Version Control .

	//clone project in your local drive
	cd drivename
	mkdir projecnameversion
	cd projecnameversion
	git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dreamhouse.git
	cd retriveFoldername

	//Create a branch for project
	git checkout -b my_branch

	sfdx force --help

5. Create and Test Our Scratch Org
   Run config/project-scratch-def.json
   //create the scratch org, set it as your default, and give it an alias:
   sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a dreamhouse-org
   // command uses the Salesforce front door to automatically log in with our cached authentication token no need of password
   sfdx force:org:open
   //Push Source Metadata to Scratch Org
   sfdx force:source:push

   sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Dreamhouse

   //Test Your App in the Scratch Org
   sfdx force:org:open




Create an App :

sfdx force:project:create -n geolocation


IDEA :


from VCS all the code gone stay .

As developer copy master branch and create a new branch and place all the changes in it.
Collabarate with person 
.Merge Code To new Vesrion of Git Master Branch.
.From NewMaster Branch Deploye code in to Sandbox,PreProd,Production.
.Packages to installation between env.
